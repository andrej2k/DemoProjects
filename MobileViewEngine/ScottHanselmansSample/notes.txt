This directory contains sample of ViewEngine implementation suggested by Scott here:
http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ABetterASPNETMVCMobileDeviceCapabilitiesViewEngine.aspx

The solution still is broken in MVC 2.0 and 3.0 RTM.
You can repeat it by your self:
Mak shulre that view caching is turned by compilation debug option set to fale:
     <compilation debug="false" ..
1. Restart the web server to flash cache.
2. Go to the web site with desktop browser. The desktop version is displayed.
3. Go to the web site from iPhone. (you can use User Agent swithcer plug-in for FireFox)
//Expected: The iPhone view to display
//Actual: The desktop view is displayed

That happens becaus browser view was already cached.
